# Flashcard-App
This is my experimental app for the lent half of 2021.

This app has a menu view which allows you to navigate between different views.

There will be a flashcard view where you practice the flashcards you have created. This allows you to flip between views on the card as well as going to the previous and next card.

An image will be shown here as the app progresses.

There is also a create flashcard view which will also allow you to create flashcards in an easy to navigate way. There will be options to add images and text.

There will also be a quiz view where you can quiz yourself on the flashcards you created with multiple choice, or just text questions.

There will also be a way to store your completed flashcards in a database and make it public or private. 

In the menu view you can decide which quiz you would like to do and if it becomes more popular, there will be a search view to browse quizzes.

At the moment it will be singleplayer mainly used for someone who wants an easier way to create flashcards, without the worry of losing it or having them ruined.

There will also be a stats view where you can keep track of your good and bad questions and what topic you should focus on.

I will definetely use this app and I hope many others will aswell.
